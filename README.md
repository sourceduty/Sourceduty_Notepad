   - Utilizes tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).

3. Version 1.2:
   
   - This version contains multiple Python files (`main.py`, `templates.py`, `text_editor.py`) and a compiled executable (`Sourceduty Notepad 1.2.exe`).
   - The Python script (`main.py`) shows significant changes from version 1.0, particularly the removal of the `TEMPLATES` dictionary and associated functionalities.
   - Likely indicates the beginning of a modular approach, separating concerns into different files (`templates.py`, `text_editor.py`), although specific features of these modules are not directly comparable due to the binary nature of the `.exe` file.

4. Version 1.5:
   - This version is provided as an executable file (`Sourceduty Notepad V1.5.exe`), and a zip file (`V1.5.zip`) suggests additional resources or related files.
   - The presence of a compiled executable without source code files for easy comparison suggests this version has been packaged for distribution, indicating a more mature or user-friendly release.
   - Changes from the previous versions could include feature enhancements, bug fixes, or optimizations but are not directly accessible without analyzing the binary.

5. Version 2.0:
   
   - This version is also provided as an executable file (`Sourceduty Notepad 2.0.exe`).
   - Like version 1.5, this version appears to be compiled and packaged for end users, likely including further enhancements or major feature additions not directly visible through code inspection.
   - The jump to version 2.0 might indicate significant upgrades or new feature sets, but again, these are not directly inspectable in the binary form.

6. Version 2.3:
   
   - This version is provided as a set of Python scripts (`main.py`, `new_challenge.py`, `templates.py`, `text_editor.py`).
   - The structure suggests a more developed modular design, separating the main logic from additional features and utilities.
   - Likely introduces new features or optimizations not present in previous versions, as indicated by the addition of `new_challenge.py`.

7. Version 2.4:
   
   - Similar in structure to version 2.3, with the same set of Python scripts (`main.py`, `new_challenge.py`, `templates.py`, `text_editor.py`).
   - The main difference from version 2.3 is the updated version number in the header, suggesting a minor update or patch.
   - Indicates that this version might focus on bug fixes, optimizations, or minor enhancements.

8. Version 3.0:
   - This version is provided as both a compiled executable (`Sourceduty Notepad V3.0.exe`) and a set of Python scripts (`main.py`, `templates.py`, `text_editor.py`).
   - The addition of an executable file suggests readiness for wider distribution, while the scripts indicate ongoing development and modular design.
   - Significant changes include the reintroduction of open-source licensing comments and potential enhancements in the GUI or core functionality.

9. Version 4.0:

   - This version marks a major evolution, provided as a Python script (`Sourceduty Notepad V4.0.py`), with additional documentation and a license file.
   - The codebase shows a substantial increase in functionality, with new imports for file handling, markdown processing, document generation, and more.

Comparison and Evolution:

From Version 1.0 to Version 1.2:

   - The transition from version 1.0 to 1.2 shows a shift from a monolithic script containing all features to a more modular approach. 
   - Predefined templates are removed, potentially signaling a move towards more user-customizable or dynamic content creation.
   - The introduction of an executable file alongside modular Python scripts in version 1.2 suggests the start of packaging the application for end-user deployment while still in active development.

From Version 1.2 to Version 1.5:

   - Version 1.5 marks the transition to a fully compiled application. This version no longer includes easily accessible Python source code, implying that the focus may have shifted towards stabilizing the application and preparing it for wider distribution.
   - Given the lack of source code, the changes might include improved user interfaces, bug fixes, or added functionality that would be common in a version upgrade from 1.2 to 1.5.

From Version 1.5 to Version 2.0:

   - The jump from version 1.5 to 2.0 is significant, as indicated by the version number. This usually suggests major changes, possibly new features, a redesigned user interface, or major performance improvements.
   - Without access to the source code or detailed change logs, specific improvements are speculative, but the continuation of distributing the application as a compiled executable indicates a mature stage of development.

From Version 2.3 to Version 2.4:

   - The primary change between these two versions is an update in the version header comment, with no other functional or structural changes observed in the `main.py` file.
   - The identical file structure suggests that version 2.4 might have focused on minor improvements or fixes rather than major feature additions.

From Version 2.4 to Version 3.0:

   - Version 3.0 introduces a new comment in the header indicating the software's open-source nature, alongside new import statements for additional modules.

   - The introduction of new templates and features such as dark/light mode, text statistics, and password generation represents a substantial expansion of the application's capabilities.
   - The overall structure and design of the code indicate a mature and feature-rich product, moving towards a comprehensive text-editing solution.

Inferences and Conclusions:

- The progression from version 1.0 to 4.0 shows a clear trajectory from initial development with raw code accessible to a refined, feature-rich application.
- Early versions focused on basic text-editing functionalities, while later versions introduced user-centric features, enhanced modularity, and a more polished user experience.
